    <h1>Chapter 2</h1>


    <p>The farmhouse stood in the fading light of the day, its silhouette a dark outline against the twilight sky. Ethan approached cautiously, his footsteps muffled by the overgrown grass. The house was old and weathered, with peeling paint and broken shutters. It looked abandoned, yet there was a strange sense of life about it, as though it were waiting for someone to come.</p>

    <br>
    <p>As he reached the porch, he noticed a small, rusted bell hanging by the door. Ethan hesitated before giving it a gentle pull. The bell’s faint, melancholic ring echoed through the stillness. He waited, listening intently for any response, but only the quiet chirping of crickets met his ears.</p>
    
    <br>
    <p>Pushing the door open, Ethan stepped inside. The interior was dimly lit by the last rays of the setting sun filtering through dusty windows. The smell of aged wood and mustiness filled the air. Ethan's eyes adjusted to the darkness, revealing a large room with a stone fireplace, old furniture covered in white sheets, and shelves lined with dusty books and jars.</p>
     <br>

     
     <p>He carefully walked across the creaky wooden floor, scanning the room for anything useful. On a table near the fireplace, he found a stack of papers and an old journal. His curiosity piqued, he picked up the journal and flipped through its pages. The writing was faded but legible, chronicling the daily life of a family who had lived in the farmhouse long ago.</p>
<br>
<p>One entry caught his eye: “The mist grows thicker. We can’t see beyond the edge of the fields. We hear whispers in the night. Something is coming.”</p>

<br>
<p>Ethan shivered. The description of the mist matched what he had seen in the city. He turned to the next page, but the ink had smudged, leaving the rest of the entry unreadable. He felt a pang of unease; the whispers mentioned in the journal were a stark reminder of the mysterious circumstances surrounding his own situation.</p>

<br>

<p>Setting the journal aside, Ethan continued exploring the house. In a corner of the kitchen, he found a small pantry stocked with canned goods and dried herbs. It wasn’t much, but it would sustain him for a while. He also discovered a flashlight and a map pinned to the wall, marked with various locations. The map seemed to show nearby towns and landmarks, including a place labeled “Haven.”</p>

<br>
<p>The word "Haven" intrigued him. It might be a lead to other people or clues about what had happened. With the sky darkening, Ethan decided to spend the night in the farmhouse. He lit a few candles he found in a cupboard and set up a makeshift bed in front of the fireplace.</p>

<br>
<p>As he settled down, the silence of the farmhouse was occasionally interrupted by the distant hoot of an owl or the rustling of leaves outside. The peaceful sounds of nature contrasted sharply with the eerie emptiness of his surroundings. Ethan tried to calm his racing thoughts, focusing on the hope that the map could lead him to answers.</p>
<br>

<p>In the early hours of the morning, he was jolted awake by a faint, haunting sound—a whispering, almost imperceptible, like voices carried by the wind. Ethan sat up, straining to hear. The whispers seemed to come from outside the farmhouse, and although he couldn’t make out any words, they sent a chill down his spine.</p>
<br>


<p>Summoning his courage, Ethan grabbed his flashlight and stepped outside into the cold, crisp air. The whispers grew louder as he walked toward the edge of the field, where the mist from the previous night had returned, swirling and shifting in the darkness. The mist seemed to beckon him, and as he ventured closer, he could just make out faint, shimmering shapes within it.</p>

<br>
<p>Ethan felt a mix of fear and fascination. The whispers were getting clearer, though still indistinct. He had to know more. With the flashlight in one hand and his backpack in the other, he pushed forward into the mist, determined to uncover the source of the strange sounds and find out if there was anyone else left in the <br>

    The mist enveloped him, and as he moved deeper into its embrace, the whispers grew louder, more insistent. Ethan's heart raced with anticipation.<br> The answers he sought were just beyond the veil of the mist, and he was ready to face whatever lay ahead.
